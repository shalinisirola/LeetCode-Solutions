## 📝 **Problem Description**

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day.

Find the **maximum profit** you can achieve. You may complete **at most two transactions**.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

## 📌 **Example 1**

**Input:**  
`prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]`

**Output:**  
`6`

**Explanation:**  
Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = `3 - 0 = 3`.  
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = `4 - 1 = 3`.

---

## 📌 **Example 2**

**Input:**  
`prices = [1,2,3,4,5]`

**Output:**  
`4`

**Explanation:**  
Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = `5 - 1 = 4`.  
You cannot buy on day 1 and day 2 simultaneously; you must sell before buying again.

---

## 📌 **Example 3**

**Input:**  
`prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`

**Output:**  
`0`

**Explanation:**  
No transaction is done, so the maximum profit is `0`.

---

## 🔒 **Constraints**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^5`
