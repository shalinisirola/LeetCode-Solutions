## 📝 **Problem Description**

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of **even length** consisting of an equal number of **positive** and **negative** integers.

You should rearrange the array such that it satisfies the following conditions:

- Every consecutive pair of integers has **opposite signs**
- For all integers with the same sign, the **relative order is preserved**
- The rearranged array **begins with a positive integer**

Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the above conditions.

## 📌 **Example 1**

**Input:**  
`nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]`

**Output:**  
`[3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]`

**Explanation:**  
The positive integers in `nums` are `[3,1,2]`.  
The negative integers are `[-2,-5,-4]`.  

The only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions is:  
`[3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]`.

Other arrangements such as `[1,-2,2,-5,3,-4]`, `[3,1,2,-2,-5,-4]`, `[-2,3,-5,1,-4,2]` are incorrect because they violate one or more conditions.

## 📌 **Example 2**

**Input:**  
`nums = [-1,1]`

**Output:**  
`[1,-1]`

**Explanation:**  
`1` is the only positive integer and `-1` is the only negative integer in `nums`.  
So the array is rearranged to `[1,-1]`.
