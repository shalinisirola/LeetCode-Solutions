## 📌 **Example 1**

**Input:**  
`nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]`

**Output:**  
`4`

**Explanation:**  
The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.  
Therefore, its length is `4`.

## 📌 **Example 2**

**Input:**  
`nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]`

**Output:**  
`9`

## 📌 **Example 3**

**Input:**  
`nums = [1,0,1,2]`

**Output:**  
`3`

---

## 🔒 **Constraints**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
