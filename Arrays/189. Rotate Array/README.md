## 📝 **Problem Description**

Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

---

## 📌 **Example 1**

**Input:**  
`nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3`

**Output:**  
`[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`

**Explanation:**  
rotate 1 steps to the right: `[7,1,2,3,4,5,6]`  
rotate 2 steps to the right: `[6,7,1,2,3,4,5]`  
rotate 3 steps to the right: `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`

---

## 📌 **Example 2**

**Input:**  
`nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2`

**Output:**  
`[3,99,-1,-100]`

**Explanation:**  
rotate 1 steps to the right: `[99,-1,-100,3]`  
rotate 2 steps to the right: `[3,99,-1,-100]`

---

## 🔒 **Constraints**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `0 <= k <= 10^5`
