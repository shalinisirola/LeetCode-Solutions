## 📝 **Problem Description**

Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is **fully (left and right) justified**.

You should pack the words using a **greedy** approach — put as many words as you can in each line.  
Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

- Extra spaces between words should be distributed as **evenly as possible**.
- If the number of spaces on a line does **not** divide evenly between words, the slots on the **left** should get more spaces than the slots on the right.
- The **last line** of text must be **left-justified**, and no extra spaces should be inserted between words (only trailing spaces at the end if needed).

### Notes

- A word is defined as a sequence of **non-space characters**.
- Each word’s length is `> 0` and `<= maxWidth`.
- The input array `words` contains **at least one word**.
