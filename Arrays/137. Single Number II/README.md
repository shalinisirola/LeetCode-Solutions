## 📝 **Problem Description**

Given an integer array `nums` where **every element appears three times except for one**, which appears **exactly once**, find the single element and return it.

You must implement a solution with **linear runtime complexity** and use only **constant extra space**.

## 📌 **Example 1**

**Input:**  
`nums = [2,2,3,2]`

**Output:**  
`3`

## 📌 **Example 2**

**Input:**  
`nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]`

**Output:**  
`99`

## 🔒 **Constraints**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- Each element in `nums` appears **exactly three times** except for one element which appears **once**
