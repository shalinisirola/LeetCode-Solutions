**Difficulty:** Medium  
**LeetCode Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/

---

## 📝 **Problem Description**

Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the **filled cells** need to be validated according to the following rules:

1. Each **row** must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.  
2. Each **column** must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.  
3. Each of the nine `3 x 3` **sub-boxes** of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

### Note

- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.  
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

## 📌 **Example 1**

<!-- Replace the path below with the actual path/URL of your Sudoku image in the repo -->
![Valid Sudoku Board](images/valid-sudoku.png)

**Input:**
```text
board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".","..","]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
```

**Output:**
```text
true
```

## 📌 **Example 2**

**Input:**
```text
board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
```

**Output:**
```text
false
```

**Explanation:**  
Same as Example 1, except the `5` in the top-left corner is changed to `8`.  
Since there are **two `8`s** in the top-left `3 x 3` sub-box, the board is invalid.

## 🔒 **Constraints**

- `board.length == 9`  
- `board[i].length == 9`  
- `board[i][j]` is a digit `'1'`–`'9'` or `'.'`
